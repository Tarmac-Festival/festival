    "text1": "We have drawn a fundamentally positive conclusion after the TARMAC Festival 2022. We organized the festival for the first time as a non profit organization and were able to further improve our structures and processes.<br><br>One of the biggest challenges on the TARMAC festival site in Allstedt is the supply of drinking water. Since there is no stationary water connection on site, we rely on a mobile drinking water system and the constant supply of water in water tanks by service providers. To ensure the quality of the drinking water, the water quality is monitored in cooperation with the health department. Starting on Friday of the festival, we had to shut down our drinking water system because critical limits could no longer be met. In order not to have to cancel the festival, we pooled all the resources at our disposal and procured bottled drinking water as an alternative. In this way, a basic supply of drinking water could be maintained. Unfortunately, the shower and hand washing stations had to remain closed. We would like to take this opportunity to apologize for this situation and the inconvenience it caused! Nevertheless, we hope that our emergency solution could also save your festival experience and that you will have good memories of TARMAC 2022 despite these restrictions.<br><br>For TARMAC 2023, we are working to ensure that such a situation cannot occur again and that drinking water will be permanently available for the event.",

After the ticket sales, there will also be the possibility to apply as a helper in the summer.<br><br>Ticket sales have unfortunately led to disappointment for many in the last two years, as tickets were sold out very quickly. We are not satisfied with this situation either. Last year, we have already tried to improve the situation with a new ticket provider, additional server capacity and an increase in the number of tickets. This year there will also be a small increase in the ticket contingent. We are trying to further improve the stability during the ordering process, too. The option to raffle the tickets has been examined, but is impractical for us due to financial and organizational reasons.<br><br>However, due to your feedback on ticket sales, we have decided to split the ticket sales. On 23.02.2023 and on 26.02.2023 half of the ticket contingent will be released from 18:00 each day.<br><br>A festival ticket will cost 155,00€ (plus advance booking fees). As in previous years, there will also be camper tickets for vehicles on the campsite.<br><br>This year there are also <strong>participation tickets</strong>.<br>These are for people with impairments.<br>The participation tickets will NOT be sold in February.<br>For registration there will be an extra form <a href='#contact'>here</a>"

Early influences where DJ`s like Sven Väth or DJ Dag and first experiences in technoclubs, like the legendary Omen or Dorian Gray in Frankfurt A.M.<br>He started to spin techno tunes at small parties until the psytrance virus changed his musical direction. With a bunch of friends – the Gecko Crew \u00AD he organised a couple of small parties in his home area, and begann to play progressive/psytrance Dj sets under the alias Yan Gecko. After a couple of years, with lots of national and some international gigs, he joined BMSS Records and released a few tracks on different compilations.<br>Yans favourite was always rather deep and mystical sound. After some life changing dancefloor experiences at big festivals, he fell completely in love with forest psy and more nighttime orientated music\u00AD 2012 the Sequoya project was born. The debut EP \"Nomad\" came out in 2013 on BMSS Records, 2015 the \"Singularity EP\" on Sangoma, followed by tracks on various Compilations from different Labels. His music can be described as deep and driving forest psy with a unique style of storytelling and remarkable sounddesign, resulting from Yans love for modular Synthesizers."
