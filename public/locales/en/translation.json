        "text1": "We have drawn a fundamentally positive conclusion after the TARMAC Festival 2022. We organized the festival for the first time as a non profit organization and were able to further improve our structures and processes.<br><br>One of the biggest challenges on the TARMAC festival site in Allstedt is the supply of drinking water. Since there is no stationary water connection on site, we rely on a mobile drinking water system and the constant supply of water in water tanks by service providers. To ensure the quality of the drinking water, the water quality is monitored in cooperation with the health department. Starting on Friday of the festival, we had to shut down our drinking water system because critical limits could no longer be met. In order not to have to cancel the festival, we pooled all the resources at our disposal and procured bottled drinking water as an alternative. In this way, a basic supply of drinking water could be maintained. Unfortunately, the shower and hand washing stations had to remain closed. We would like to take this opportunity to apologize for this situation and the inconvenience it caused! Nevertheless, we hope that our emergency solution could also save your festival experience and that you will have good memories of TARMAC 2022 despite these restrictions.<br><br>For TARMAC 2023, we are working to ensure that such a situation cannot occur again and that drinking water will be permanently available for the event.",

After the ticket sales, there will also be the possibility to apply as a helper in the summer.<br><br>Ticket sales have unfortunately led to disappointment for many in the last two years, as tickets were sold out very quickly. We are not satisfied with this situation either. Last year, we have already tried to improve the situation with a new ticket provider, additional server capacity and an increase in the number of tickets. This year there will also be a small increase in the ticket contingent. We are trying to further improve the stability during the ordering process, too. The option to raffle the tickets has been examined, but is impractical for us due to financial and organizational reasons.<br><br>However, due to your feedback on ticket sales, we have decided to split the ticket sales. On 23.02.2023 and on 26.02.2023 half of the ticket contingent will be released from 18:00 each day.<br><br>A festival ticket will cost 155,00€ (plus advance booking fees). As in previous years, there will also be camper tickets for vehicles on the campsite.<br><br>This year there are also <strong>accessibility tickets</strong>.<br>These are for people with impairments.<br>The accessibility tickets will NOT be sold in February.<br>For registration there will be an extra form <a href='#contact'>here</a>"

In this newsletter, we want to explain how we at TARMAC Festival are dealing with rising prices and increased expenses while keeping things as fair as possible for you. Spoiler: Ticket prices for TARMAC 2025 will see a moderate increase &ndash; as little as possible, but as much as necessary.</p>\r\n<p>As little as possible means that, as a charitable organisation, we always aim to create a budget that just covers the expected costs, with a small safety buffer for any unexpected expenses. As much as necessary means that we calculate costs responsibly to make a festival like TARMAC happen &ndash; four days across more than 10 stages and venues.</p>\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t plan to increase the total number of attendees, and we&rsquo;ll still allow you to bring your own drinks. That leaves us with only one way to adjust the budget: ticket prices. We recognise this and hope for your understanding.</p>\r\n<p>To strike the right balance between &ldquo;as little as possible&rdquo; and &ldquo;as much as necessary,&rdquo; we&rsquo;re introducing two ticket tiers with fixed quotas (all prices exclude the TixforGigs booking fee):</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tier 1:</strong> 15% of all tickets in our shop are &ldquo;Supporter Tickets.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tier 2:</strong> 85% of all tickets are our &ldquo;Regular Tickets.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The idea is simple: 15% of visitors who choose to buy the more expensive Supporter Ticket make it possible for the other 85% to get tickets at a lower price. This allows us to limit the price increase for Regular Tickets to &euro;185. The Supporter Ticket will cost &euro;205.</p>\r\n<p>Since the Regular Tickets are only affordable if the quota of Supporter Tickets sells out, the first round of sales on 14th March at 10 am will offer Supporter Tickets only. Regular Tickets will only be available in the second round at 6 pm on the same day. In theory, you can purchase tickets in both rounds. Our Camper Tickets (&euro;40) will be available at any time, as long as supplies last.</p>\r\n<p>From experience, our tickets sell out within minutes &ndash; we&rsquo;re incredibly grateful for that! We also want to give a big shout-out to our amazing TARMAC crew, who make this ticket model possible by working voluntarily and without adequate payment. We hope that a sufficient number of you are able and willing to buy a ticket in the first round, helping us to share the financial load. In this sense, the Supporter Ticket truly supports the TARMAC community!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Accessibility Tickets</strong></p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re happy to announce that we&rsquo;ll once again be offering a quota of Accessibility Tickets this year. You can apply for an Accessibility Ticket via email from mid-April. The ticket costs &euro;95 and you can bring your personal assistants free of charge. You can find all the details on our website.</p>\r\n<p><em>End of the updates.</em></p>\r\n<p>No matter which ticket you choose, we&rsquo;re already looking forward to having an unforgettable time with you at the TARMAC Festival. If you&rsquo;re interested in volunteering, applications will likely open again in mid-June &ndash; more info to come.</p>"

We would like to thank all the associations , collectives, groups and individuals who keep coming to us and swinging their cordless screwdrivers for a hot meal and cold showers. Without this willingness and the&nbsp; wholesome actionism of the crew, this special rave culture would be unthinkable.</p><p>No party without guests. A&nbsp; huge thank you also goes out to all rave lovers and culture enthusiasts who visit our small and large stages and create an incomparable atmosphere for us.&nbsp;</p><p>The year 2023 has&nbsp; shown us clearly that there is still a high demand for niche projects in the music and culture scene. The renewed run on tickets and the numerous applications for accessibility are also a subcultural statement for us. Our small festival has also taught us that not everything always has to be perfect. Dedication and transparency have helped us to overcome hurdles and break down barriers.&nbsp;</p><p>Special thanks therefore go to all the teams involved, who provided us with particularly strong support in these areas: Accessibility, Awareness, Psycare, Security, Medical Services.</p><p>There are also three topics that are particularly important to us in connection with the 2023 festival, which have repeatedly caused us sleepless nights and will play a major role in our plenaries in winter.</p>",

We quote ourselves from last year's newsletter after we had digested the 2022 water scenario.</p><p><em>\"For TARMAC 2023, we are working to ensure that such a situation cannot occur again and that drinking water quality will be permanently available for the event.\" (TARMAC e.V.; 11/2022)</em></p><p>We say <em>touch&eacute;</em> here and look back with a smile and a tear in our eye. In principle, of course, this sentence is actually correct. To shed some light on this, we would like to talk about the 2023 water supply once again.</p><p>As a team, we spent a year working intensively on the problem and implemented the best solution for the 2023 festival. To do this, we invested in a new drinking water supply system and expanded our cooperation with the public health department and the relevant laboratories. Unfortunately, we did not&nbsp; plan for the fact that our drinking water supplier would not be able to supply adequate clean water. Thanks to a tireless team, we have found another company that has spared us a situation like 2022 in the nick of time. Shout-outs at this point also to the airfield management, who provided us with alternative shower facilities at short notice. We are now going to go out on a limb and say that we will be able to offer drinking water from the tap permanently&nbsp; for TARMAC 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the people who have supported us in this difficult situation and have&nbsp; shown understanding despite the tense situation.</p><p>We can't wait to see how this story continues and would like to use our network at this point to close the topic of water with a smile and a tear:</p><p>As you know, our last-minute rescheduling meant that we bought a lot of bottled drinking water. You certainly remember the lovely fizz in your throats. Around 26 pallets of this water were stolen from the airfield in the fall. Unfortunately, we&nbsp; did not have enough secure storage space for these large quantities of water. Ironically, only the Euro pallets were left behind. We therefore assume that the crates were all loaded separately . So, if somebody offers you large quantities of drinking water - around 1000 crates - please let us know. In addition to the missing raw material, the financial loss is of course also significant.</p>"

Early influences where DJ`s like Sven Väth or DJ Dag and first experiences in technoclubs, like the legendary Omen or Dorian Gray in Frankfurt A.M.<br>He started to spin techno tunes at small parties until the psytrance virus changed his musical direction. With a bunch of friends – the Gecko Crew \u00AD he organised a couple of small parties in his home area, and begann to play progressive/psytrance Dj sets under the alias Yan Gecko. After a couple of years, with lots of national and some international gigs, he joined BMSS Records and released a few tracks on different compilations.<br>Yans favourite was always rather deep and mystical sound. After some life changing dancefloor experiences at big festivals, he fell completely in love with forest psy and more nighttime orientated music\u00AD 2012 the Sequoya project was born. The debut EP \"Nomad\" came out in 2013 on BMSS Records, 2015 the \"Singularity EP\" on Sangoma, followed by tracks on various Compilations from different Labels. His music can be described as deep and driving forest psy with a unique style of storytelling and remarkable sounddesign, resulting from Yans love for modular Synthesizers."
